## Overview

Minimal Twitter OAuth Lib 🐦
This library has the following functions.
- Request token
- Access token
- Beare Token

You can only get three function
so

If you wanna another function, you gatta add your wanna function

I also considered Fork, but I decided to do this because I would have to remove most of it.

The OAuth function has been removed from the library below.
